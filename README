A Timer application with two options.  A single up/down timer or a dependent timer.

In order to properly compile this program in a linux environment you must install the qt4 libraries if 
they are not already on your system.  To do this run this command from the terminal:

sudo apt-get install libxtst-dev build-essential libqt4-dev qt4-qmake

In order to run the program enter the finalTimer directory, run the command:
qmake
Once that finishes run the command
make
This should create an executable called finalTimer.  To execute the program type ./finalTimer


User instructions:

There are two buttons in the main window.  The single timer button lauches a window that has a single count up or 
count down timer.  There are two options to choose  what will occur when the timer finishes.  The dependent timer button launches
a new timer that has dependencies. There is a About button for user instructions.
